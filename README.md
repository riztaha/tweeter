# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

I built this by praciticing my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
5. Enter your name in the pop-up.
6. A list of pre-made tweets should appear. Press the 'Create a new tweet' button on the top right.
7. You may submit a tweet and it will appear in the feed below. (Currently there is no functionality for users to create tweets with their own name attached to the tweet.)

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above
